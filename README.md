For AssignmentTabler, that was an IOS application that I had created for IOS App Development. The purpose of the able was to create a To List application that would allow the user to add tasks to their to do list, to check them off when those tasks are completed, and to delete tasks if necessary. This application was created using xcode and was written in Swift. This was my first time doing mobile app development and using both xcode and swift. It was very fun to be able to do this. This is also what helped spark the idea of making a mobile app for the senior project.

For groupProjectDatabses, we had created an recipe databases using MySQL for Databases. The purpose of the application was to certain for certain recipes based on keywords, categories, etc. We manually added recipes into the database ourselves. This class was the first time I have ever implemented a database and my very first time using MySQL. It was very very easy to understand the implementation of it. I had a great time learning backend development and I have had thoughts on doing backend work for jobs, but that has not been decided yet.

For homework1Part2, we had to create a java file that took URLs and copied them with either text files and with binary files for Computer Networks. It was tricky to implement the methods in this class to get the functionality to work, but once I got it figured out it was a breeze. This assignment taught me how to use InputStreams and OutputStreams in order to achieve this.

For hw2Compilers, we created Parser rules for Compilers using ANTLR. This was the first time that I had ever touched base with ANTLR. We learned how to implement parser and lexer to generate AST node trees. It was fun to use test files and to see the Ast Node Tree break each part into leaves and branches, based on how both the lexer and parser rules were set up.


For lab2, this was an application that matched residents with their hospital references and vice versa by using Python for Algorithms and Datastructures. This was the first time I was actually coded with Python code. It was quite a challenge I felt for myself to learn how to code in Python when being so used to always using java. The point of the lab was to read files into the Python command line and it would print the residents preferences for hospitals and so forth. It was interesting running python code only through the command line, but you get used to it after more practice.
